        <p class="chessInfo">
            Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games,
            played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of
            contrasting colours,
            commonly <span class="white">white</span> and <span class="black">black.</span> White moves first,
            after which the players alternate turns in accordance with fixed rules,
            each player attempting to force the opponent’s principal piece,
            <strong><em>the King</em></strong>,
            into checkmate—a position where it is unable to avoid <strong><u>capture</u></strong>.
